# Boss-of-the-SOC-BOTS---Threat-Hunting-Using-Splunk
###
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, organizations face an increasing number of sophisticated cyber threats that can bypass traditional security defenses. To stay ahead of adversaries, proactive security measures such as threat hunting have become crucial. Splunk, a leading data analysis platform, offers powerful capabilities for threat hunting, enabling security teams/organisations to collect, analyse, and gain insights from vast amounts of machine-generated data to detect and mitigate potential risks before they escalate.
